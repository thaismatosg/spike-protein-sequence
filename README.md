A SARS-CoV-2 variant belonging to Pango lineage B.1.1.529, with a high number of S-gene mutations compared
to the original virus was detected at the beginning of November 2021. On 26 November 2021 the variant was
designated a variant of concern (VOC) and assigned the label Omicron by the World Health Organization
(WHO). The variant is characterised by 30 changes, three small deletions and one small insertion in the spike
protein, of these, 15 are in the receptor binding domain. This variant was first detected in samples collected on
11 November 2021 in Botswana and on 14 November 2021 in South Africa. As of 26 November 2021, travelrelated cases have also been detected in Belgium, Hong Kong and Israel. The Omicron variant is the most
divergent variant that has been detected in significant numbers during the pandemic so far, which raises
concerns that it may be associated with increased transmissibility, significant reduction in vaccine effectiveness
and increased risk for reinfections. As of 26 November 2021, ECDC has classified this variant as a variant of
concern (VOC) due to concerns regarding immune escape and potentially increased transmissibility compared to
the Delta variant.

# * About the project:
Receive as input a protein sequence and generate a mutant sequence, following a list of mutations.
  
# * Substitutions:
Amino acid - position and amino acid to which it was fined A67 - an alanine at position 67 was replaced with a valine.

# * Deletions:
Del70-73 - region 70,71,72,73 has been deleted.

# * Inserts: 
The position and sequence that was inserted will be encoded with inss - ins214EPE - that is, an EPE was inserted at position 214.
